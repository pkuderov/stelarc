> *Spatio-TEmporal Learning And Recursive Computing*  
> *(Named in homage to the performance artist Stelarc)*

`Stelarc` is a biologically inspired, memory-driven vision agent for the `oculr` environment.  
It actively explores visual scenes by moving its gaze, remembering what it saw, and learning to perceive over time.

Key ideas:
- Active visual exploration through saccadic control
- Local, online, and recurrent learning
- Memory architectures for temporal inference
- Designed as an alternative to gradient-based, static vision pipelines

Like its namesake, **Stelarc** explores the boundaries between body, machine, and cognition ‚Äî reimagining perception as an embodied act of agency.

### üß¨ Why ‚ÄúStelarc‚Äù?

The agent is named after **Stelarc**, a pioneering performance artist whose work explored the fusion of human bodies and technology ‚Äî prosthetics, robotics, and remote sensory systems. This project draws inspiration from that vision:

- Seeing is an act of control
- Memory is part of perception
- Learning is not just statistical ‚Äî it's embodied

Just as Stelarc questioned the limitations of the flesh, this agent questions the limitations of feedforward perception.
